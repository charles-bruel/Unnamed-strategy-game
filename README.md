# Unnamed-strategy-game

This is an unnamed strategy I started writing and abandoned a long time ago. This is the most developed game iteration I could find (although I think I got further and lost the file). Ahh the days before I knew about github. Either way, this is here just for posteritie's sake. I abadoned this iteration of the game after running into performance issues with Java Swing. Why did I use Java and Swing? Because it was what I knew. I made an attempt to rewrite the renderer in OpenGL but that never got finished either. I've included that as a branch of this repo.

This branch is the OpenGL branch. I tried rewriting the game in OpenGL, with very minimal support. I wrote a helper library (which is in a different repo) but I didn't have any kind of engine or anything. This attempt never reached feature parity with the original version, and given how unfinished that was, that's bad. It did run faster, so mission accomplished?
