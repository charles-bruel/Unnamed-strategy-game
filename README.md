# Unnamed-strategy-game

This is an unnamed strategy I started writing and abandoned a long time ago. This is the most developed game iteration I could find (although I think I got further and lost the file). Ahh the days before I knew about github. Either way, this is here just for posteritie's sake. I abadoned this iteration of the game after running into performance issues with Java Swing. Why did I use Java and Swing? Because it was what I knew. I made an attempt to rewrite the renderer in OpenGL but that never got finished either. I've included that as a branch of this repo.
